To get this running on your machine you must have Python installed and a Virtual Environment Created

I suggest splitting your terminal, download python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the backend:
python app.py

in the other run:
cd student-section-fronted

then download react dependencies
npm ci

Start the frontend:
npm start
